## Naming

###  Scope note: 
Naming is a process by which a proper name is attached to a place, person or thing. The process of naming new places is described in many Sagas of Icelanders and Landnámabók, and is one of the means by which space becomes place and ties with a new place are established, land is claimed by individuals, and land-claims are legitimised.  

### Examples: 

* Landnámabók relates how the island known today as Iceland is first called Snæland (Snowland), then Garðarshólmi (Garðar's Island), then Ísland (Iceland)

* Vatsndæla saga describes how Ingimundur gamli explores and claims land in north Iceland, naming places along the way on the basis of what natural features look like, what events happened there, what individuals established settlements on specific sties. 

* Vatnsdæla describes how Vigdís (Ingimundur gamli's wife) gives birth to a daughter as the family explore the Vatndalur area. The daughter is given the name Þórdís, and the place where she was born, Þórdísarholt.
