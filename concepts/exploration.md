## Exploration

###  Scope note: 
Exploration is a key theme in study of Viking Age Scandinavia. Various explanations and theories have attempted to understand the dynamics and aspects of exploration in the Viking Age period (e.g. social and economic pressures on land and agricultural production; political developments; technological developments etc). By the time the Sagas of Icelanders were being written down in the 13th century, travel and exploration -- the discovery and settlement of Iceland -- had become a trope in these narratives and a key part of the construction of Icelandic identity.   

### Examples: 

* discovery and exploration of Iceland, as related in Landnámabók and Sagas of Icelanders

* discovery and exploration of Greenland, as related in Eiríks saga rauða and Grænlendinga saga 

* discovery and exploration of regions along the eastern seaboard of North America, as related in Eiríks saga rauða and Grænlendinga saga
