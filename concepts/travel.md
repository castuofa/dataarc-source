## Travel

###  Scope note: 
Travel was fundamental to the Viking Age and medieval Scandinavian world. Networks of various kinds (trading, raiding, patronage, political, relgious, social etc) were formed between Norse communities and societies all around the North Atlantic seaboard. Movement was in all directions and influence was reciprocal. Travel was undertaken on land primarily by foot or on horseback, sometimes with carts (in the winter on skis or sleds), and travel over water was on boats or ships with different capacities and functions. 

### Examples: 

* travel from farmstead to local assembly

* travel around a local area to round up livestock

* travel from Iceland to Norway, perhaps to the royal court or some other important centre

* travel from Scandinavia to Rome for the purposes of pilgrimage
